title: "Reliable File Transfer using custom Mason Transport Protocol (MTP)"
summary: "This project implements a custom made TCP protocal called MTP, a reliable file transfer protocol over UDP. MTP ensures in-order, reliable delivery of datagrams in the presence of packet loss and corruption. A sender and receiver communicate over UDP, with the sender transferring a file and the receiver verifying its integrity upon completion. The project demonstrates key concepts of reliable data transfer, error handling, and transport layer protocols."
